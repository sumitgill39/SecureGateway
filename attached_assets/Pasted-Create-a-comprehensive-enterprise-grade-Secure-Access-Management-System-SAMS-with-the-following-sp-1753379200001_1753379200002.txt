Create a comprehensive enterprise-grade Secure Access Management System (SAMS) with the following specifications:

## Core Architecture Requirements:

### 1. Multi-Domain LDAP Authentication
- Support connecting to multiple LDAP servers simultaneously
- Handle users from different organizational domains
- Implement domain-based routing for authentication
- Support LDAP failover and load balancing

### 2. Application Onboarding & Inventory Management
- Application registration system with metadata:
  - Application name, owner, criticality level
  - Environment classification (DEV, QA, UAT, STAGE, PREPROD, PROD, DR)
  - Associated infrastructure (servers, containers, databases)
- Tag-based infrastructure sharing system:
  - Resources can have multiple tags
  - If server/container shares tags with multiple applications, it appears in all relevant application inventories
  - Tag inheritance and hierarchical tagging support

### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Roles: Admin, Technical Project Owner (TPO), Developer, QA Engineer
- Technical Project Owners can:
  - Define team access permissions per environment
  - Grant/revoke access to specific team members
  - Set environment-specific access policies (e.g., DEV=read/write, PROD=read-only)
- Granular permission matrix per application/environment/resource

### 4. Identity & Access Management (IAM) Integration
- API integration with enterprise IAM systems (Okta, Azure AD, Ping Identity)
- Automatic group membership synchronization
- Just-In-Time (JIT) access provisioning
- SAML/OAuth2/OIDC support

### 5. Access Request Workflow
- Self-service request portal with:
  - Resource browser (filtered by user's application access)
  - Reason for access with business justification
  - Requested duration
- Approval workflow:
  - Automatic routing to appropriate TPO based on application ownership
  - Email/Slack/Teams notifications
  - Approval dashboard for TPOs
- Time-boxed access options: 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes
- Access types:
  - Read-only (view files, run diagnostic commands)
  - Read-write (full access with restrictions on sensitive operations)
  - Emergency break-glass (with additional approvals)

### 6. Security & Compliance Features
- Real-time session monitoring and recording
- Command logging with:
  - Timestamp, user, resource, command executed
  - Output capture for sensitive commands
  - Intelligent filtering of passwords/secrets in logs
- Sensitive file/path blocking:
  - Configurable blocklist per application/environment
  - Pattern-based content masking (passwords, API keys, tokens)
  - Prevent editing of critical system files
- Automatic session termination after approved time limit
- Kill switch for TPOs to immediately revoke active sessions

### 7. Technical Implementation Details
- Web-based terminal using xterm.js or similar
- WebSocket-based real-time communication
- Containerized microservices architecture
- RESTful API for all operations
- Multi-cloud support (AWS, Azure, GCP, on-premise)
- High availability with clustering support
- Encrypted audit log storage with retention policies

### 8. User Interface Requirements
- Dashboard showing:
  - My applications and current access levels
  - Pending access requests
  - Active sessions
  - Access history
- TPO Management Console:
  - Team member access matrix
  - Infrastructure inventory management
  - Approval queue
  - Audit log viewer
  - Real-time session monitoring
- Responsive design for mobile access

### 9. Integration Requirements
- Kubernetes API for pod/container access
- SSH proxy for server access
- Docker API for container management
- Splunk/ELK/Datadog for log forwarding
- ServiceNow/Jira for ticket creation
- Slack/Teams for notifications

### 10. Additional Features
- Access analytics and reporting
- Anomaly detection for suspicious commands
- Automated compliance reports
- Resource utilization tracking
- Session replay functionality
- API for programmatic access requests

Build this system with:
- Modern tech stack (React/Vue/Angular frontend, Node.js/Go/Python backend)
- Microservices architecture
- Kubernetes-native deployment
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Security best practices (OWASP compliance)

Focus on creating a user-friendly, secure, and scalable solution that reduces developer friction while maintaining strict security controls. The system should be cloud-native but support hybrid deployments.
